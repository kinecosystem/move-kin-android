This repository contains modules that connect the ecosystem apps together.

## Ecosystem Apps Discovery Module
Documentation coming up very soon!
In the meantime take a look at our `Sample` apps.

## Sample Code
Any app can be both a sender and a receiver of Kin.
+ [Sample Sender App](https://github.com/kinecosystem/move-kin-android/tree/master/sampleSenderApp/) demonstrates
how to implement the discovery of other ecosystem apps and how to send Kin to another app.
+ [Sample Receiver App](https://github.com/kinecosystem/move-kin-android/tree/master/sampleReceiverApp/) demonstrates how to implement receiving Kin in your app from another ecosystem app.
